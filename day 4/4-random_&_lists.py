# Randomization and Lists

# 1. Randomization
# Randomization is the process of making something random. 
# - In practice, randomization is not truly random, but rather pseudo-random. 
# - This video explains that: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/crypt/v/random-vs-pseudorandom-number-generators
# In Python, we can use the `random` module to generate random numbers, select random elements from a list, and shuffle lists.
# - random documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 10) # Generates a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
print(random_number)







# 2. Lists
